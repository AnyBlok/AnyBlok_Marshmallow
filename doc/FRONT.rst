Information about the AnyBlok / Marshmallow project.

Project Homepage
----------------

AnyBlok is hosted on `github <http://github.com>`_ - the main project
page is at https://github.com/AnyBlok/AnyBlok_Marshmallow. Source code is
tracked here using `GIT <https://git-scm.com>`_.

Releases and project status are available on Pypi at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/anyblok_marshmallow.

The most recent published version of this documentation should be at
http://doc.anyblok-marshmallow.anyblok.org.

Project Status
--------------

AnyBlok with Marshmallow is currently in beta status and is expected to be fairly
stable.   Users should take care to report bugs and missing features on an as-needed
basis.  It should be expected that the development version may be required
for proper implementation of recently repaired issues in between releases;

Installation
------------

Install released versions of AnyBlok from the Python package index with
`pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ or a similar tool::

    pip install anyblok_marshmallow

Installation via source distribution is via the ``setup.py`` script::

    python setup.py install

Installation will add the ``anyblok`` commands to the environment.

Unit Test
---------

Run the test with ``pytest``::

    pip install pytest pytest-cov
    ANYBLOK_DRIVER_NAME=postgres ANYBLOK_DATABASE_NAME=mybase pytest anyblok_marshmallow/tests

Dependencies
------------

AnyBlok works with **Python 3.6** and later. The install process will
ensure that `AnyBlok <http://doc.anyblok.org>`_,
`marshmallow >= 3.2.0 <https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and 
`marshmallow-sqlalchemy <https://marshmallow-sqlalchemy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ 
are installed, in addition to other dependencies. 
The latest version of them is strongly recommended.
